# Development of world economy on Gambia

This project evaluates the economic challenges and development potential of **The Gambia**, a low Human Development Index (HDI) country, compared against high‑HDI nations such as Singapore, Grenada and Latvia. By analysing socio‑economic indicators – including life expectancy, education and income – the project identifies factors contributing to The Gambia's developmental gap and proposes strategies for inclusive growth.

## Objectives

- **Data Gathering:** Curate publicly available HDI and economic indicators for The Gambia and comparator countries.
- **Comparative Analysis:** Highlight disparities in health, education, income and infrastructure relative to high‑HDI nations.
- **Visualisation:** Build clear charts and tables in a presentation format to communicate findings.
- **Recommendation:** Draw actionable recommendations for policymakers, investors and development partners.

## Data & Methodology

- **Sources:** United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) HDI reports, World Bank indicators, and secondary research on socio‑economic factors.
- **Tools:** Data processed in spreadsheets and visualised using **Microsoft PowerPoint**.
- **Approach:** Descriptive statistics and cross‑country comparisons to contextualise The Gambia's performance relative to peers.

## Key Insights

- The Gambia's HDI lags due to limited resources, historical factors and institutional challenges.
- Significant investment in education and healthcare is required to improve life expectancy and literacy rates.
- Economic diversification and stronger governance are critical to achieving sustainable, inclusive development.
- Latvia's example demonstrates how strategic investments and global integration can accelerate HDI growth.

## Deliverables

- **Presentation:** [`low HDI country.pptx`](./low%20HDI%20country.pptx) – a polished slide deck with charts, tables and narrative analysing HDI metrics across countries.
- **Documentation:** `README.md` (this file) summarises the project, methodology, findings and skills demonstrated.

## Skills Demonstrated

- **Data Analysis & Research:** Compiling and interpreting socio‑economic data from multiple sources.
- **Visual Storytelling:** Designing clear and engaging slides to communicate complex concepts.
- **Comparative Analytics:** Benchmarking countries using HDI and related indicators.
- **Strategic Thinking:** Proposing high‑level recommendations to address developmental challenges.
